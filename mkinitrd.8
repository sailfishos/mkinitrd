.TH MKINITRD 8 "Tue Aug 10 2004"
.SH NAME
mkinitrd \- creates initial ramdisk images for preloading modules
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBmkinitrd\fR [--version] [-v] [-f] 
         [--preload=\fImodule\fR] [--omit-scsi-modules] 
         [--omit-raid-modules] [--omit-lvm-modules] 
         [--with=\fImodule\fR] [--image-version]
         [--fstab=\fIfstab\fR] [--nocompress]
         [--builtin=\fImodule\fR] \fIimage\fR \fIkernel-version\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBmkinitrd\fR creates an initial image used by the kernel for
preloading the block device modules (such as IDE, SCSI or RAID)
which are needed to access the root filesystem. \fBmkinitrd\fR
automatically loads filesystem modules (such as ext3 and jbd), IDE modules, all
\fIscsi_hostadapter\fR entries in \fI/etc/modprobe.conf\fR, and raid
modules if the system's root partition is on raid, which makes it simple
to build and use kernels using modular device drivers.

Any module options specified in \fI/etc/modprobe.conf\fR are passed
to the modules as they are loaded by the initial ramdisk.

The root filesystem used by the kernel is specified in the boot configuration
file, as always. The traditional \fBroot=/dev/hda1\fR style device 
specification is allowed. If a label is used, as in \fBroot=LABEL=rootPart\fR
the initrd will search all available devices for an ext2 or ext3 filesystem
with the appropriate label, and mount that device as the root filesystem.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-\-builtin=\fR\fImodule\fR
Act as if \fImodule\fR is built into the kernel being used. \fBmkinitrd\fR
will not look for this module, and will not emit an error if it does not
exist. This option may be used multiple times.

.TP
\fB-f\fR
Allows \fBmkinitrd\fR to overwrite an existing image file.

.TP
\fB-\-fstab=\fR\fIfstab\fR
Use \fIfstab\fR to automatically determine what type of filesystem the
root device is on. Normally, \fB/etc/fstab\fR is used.

.TP
\fB-\-image-version
The kernel version number is appended to the initrd image path before the image
is created.

.TP
\fB-\-nocompress
Normally the created initrd image is compressed with \fBgzip\fR. If this
option is specified, the compression is skipped.

.TP
\fB-\-omit-lvm-modules 
Do not load any lvm modules, even if /etc/fstab expects them.

.TP
\fB-\-omit-raid-modules 
Do not load any raid modules, even if /etc/fstab and /etc/raidtab expect them.

.TP
\fB-\-omit-scsi-modules 
Do not load any scsi modules, including 'scsi_mod' and 'sd_mod'
modules, even if they are present.

.TP
\fB-\-preload=\fR\fImodule\fR
Load the module \fImodule\fR in the initial ramdisk image. The module gets
loaded before any SCSI modules which are specified in \fI/etc/modprobe.conf\fR.
This option may be used as many times as necessary.

.TP
\fB-v\fR
Prints out verbose information while creating the image (normally
the \fBmkinitrd\fR runs silently). 

.TP
\fB-\-version\fR
Prints the version of \fBmkinitrd\fR that's being used and then exits.

.TP
\fB-\-with=\fR\fImodule\fR
Load the modules \fImodule\fR in the initial ramdisk image. The module
gets loaded after any SCSI modules which are specified in 
\fI/etc/modprobe.conf\fR. This option may be used as many times as 
necessary.

.SH FILES
.PD 0
.TP 20
\fI/dev/loop*\fR
A block loopback device is used to create the image, which makes this
script useless on systems without block loopback support available
\fI(only used on kernels < 2.6)\fR

.TP 20
\fI/etc/modprobe.conf\fR
Specifies SCSI modules to be loaded and module options to be used.

.TP 20
\fI/etc/modules.conf\fR
Specifies SCSI modules to be loaded and module options to be used.
