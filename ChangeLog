	* nash/block.c (nashParseSysfsDevno):
	- use a local buffer instead of allocating
	- return ENOENT rather than ENOTDIR since we're really testing
	$path/dev rather than $path/, and that's what the caller is expecting.

2007-08-31  Peter Jones  <pjones@redhat.com>

	- check for /sys/block/loop*, and ignore it
	- don't lstat to see if it's a dir, look for $path/dev first
	- use memory on the stack for paths instead of allocating

2007-08-31  Peter Jones  <pjones@redhat.com>

	* nash/wrap.c (nash_wrap_open):

	- don't include assert.h

	* nash/uevent.c (nashGetUEventPoll):

	- add some nassert() calls.

2007-08-30  Peter Jones  <pjones@redhat.com>

	* nash/util.h:
	- add nassert() macro because the system assert() macro resets your
	sigaction to SIG_DFL after it raises the signal, making it mostly
	useless.
	- add some calls to nassert()

	* nash/wrap.c:
	- add wrappers for access and mkdir
	- sprinkle nassert() calls around liberally.

	* Makefile.inc:
	- Add linker handling for new wrappers.

2007-08-30  Peter Jones  <pjones@redhat.com>

	- don't create device nodes when "dev" wasn't found.

2007-08-28  Peter Jones  <pjones@redhat.com>

	* grubby/grubby.c:
	- Add traceback() and install it as the signal handler for SIGSEGV.

2007-08-28  Peter Jones  <pjones@redhat.com>

	* nash/util.h (gettimespecofday):
	- nanoseconds is microseconds times NSECS_PER_USEC.  Division is not
	multiplication.  Use '*' not '/'.

2007-08-28  Peter Jones  <pjones@redhat.com>

	* bdevid/scsi.c:
	- fix segfault when we get back vpd page 83 data but the unique ID
	is empty. (Reported by Yanko Kaneti, "yaneti" on #fedora-devel)
